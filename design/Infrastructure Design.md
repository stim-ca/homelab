# Infrastructure Design Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the design of the infrastructure, including the roles and responsibilities of each component. The goal of this design is to provide a secure, scalable, and reliable infrastructure that meets the requirements of the organization.

## Solution Overview

The following solutions have been selected to meet the infrastructure requirements:

1. Microsoft Active Directory: As an authentication server to provide a centralized authentication system for your network.

2. Microsoft Windows Server: As a file and print server to share files and printers within the network.

3. Duplicati: As a backup server to ensure the safety of your data.

4. Microsoft Exchange: As a mail server to manage your email communication.

5. Graylog self-hosted: As a syslog server to collect and manage log data from different systems and applications.

6. Docker Swarm: As a container server to manage the deployment and orchestration of containers.

7. Microsoft Remote Desktop Services: As a remote desktop services server to provide remote access to desktops and applications.

8. WireGuard: As a VPN server to secure remote access to your network.

## Architecture

The architecture of the infrastructure consists of the following components:

- Two authentication servers for high availability, running Microsoft Active Directory.
- One file and print server, running Microsoft Windows Server.
- One backup server, running Duplicati.
- One mail server, running Microsoft Exchange.
- One syslog server, running Graylog self-hosted.
- One container server, running Docker Swarm.
- One remote desktop services server, running Microsoft Remote Desktop Services.
- One VPN server, running WireGuard.

## Security

The following security measures have been considered in this design:

- Two-factor authentication is required to access sensitive systems and applications.
- Regular software updates are performed to ensure that the systems and applications are protected against the latest security threats.
- Data backups are performed regularly to ensure that the data can be recovered in case of a disaster.
- Network security is implemented using a firewall and VPN.
- Access to sensitive data is controlled through permissions and access controls.

## Conclusion

This infrastructure design provides a secure, scalable, and reliable solution that meets the requirements of the organization. The selected solutions have been chosen for their security, scalability, and reliability, and have been integrated to provide a cohesive and efficient infrastructure. Regular maintenance and monitoring will be performed to ensure that the infrastructure continues to meet the needs of the organization.
